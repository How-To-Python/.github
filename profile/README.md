### Data Structures
**Each data structure has its strengths and is optimized for different use cases.**
#### Core Python Data Structures
- [Lists](https://github.com/How-To-Python/PythonList): Ordered, Mutable Collections
    - Use case: Shopping carts, todo lists, any sequence that changes
    - Use when: you need an ordered, changeable collection
- [Tuples](https://github.com/How-To-Python/PythonTuples): Immutable Sequences
    - Use case: Coordinates, database records, function return values
    - Use when: you need an ordered, unchangeable collection
- [Dictionaries](https://github.com/How-To-Python/PythonDictionaries): Key-Value Mappings
    - Use case: Configuration settings, lookup tables, JSON-like data
    - Use when: you need to map keys to values
- [Sets](): Unordered Collections of Unique Elements
    - Use case: Removing duplicates, membership testing, set operations
    - Use when: you need unique elements and set operations

#### Extended Data Structures
- [Strings](): Immutable Sequences of Characters
    - Use case: Text processing, user input, file names
- [Bytes/Bytearray](): Bytes/Bytearray
    - Use case: File I/O, network communication, binary protocols

#### Specialized Collections (from collections module)
- [Named Tuples](): Tuples with Named Fields
- [Deque](): Double-Ended Queue
- [Counter](): Counting Dictionary
- [DefaultDict](): Dictionary with Default Values

#### Scientific Computing Data Structures
- [NumPy Arrays](): Numerical computing
    - Use case: Mathematical operations, scientific computing, machine learning
    - Use for: numerical computations and mathematical operations
- [Pandas DataFrames/Series](): Data analysis
    - Use case: Data analysis, CSV/Excel handling, time series
    - Use for: data analysis and manipulation
